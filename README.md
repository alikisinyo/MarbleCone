## MarbleCone Threat Profile

### Background
MarbleCone is an advanced persistent threat group originating from Tanrida. The group primarily targets governments, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure with sophisticated attack techniques.

### Key Capabilities
- **Initial Access**: Advanced phishing, exploit public-facing applications, valid accounts
- **Execution**: Command and scripting interpreters, scheduled tasks, process injection
- **Persistence**: Registry run keys, scheduled tasks, autostart execution, multiple mechanisms
- **Privilege Escalation**: Process injection, valid accounts, zero-day exploits
- **Defense Evasion**: Process injection, masquerading, advanced obfuscation
- **Credential Access**: OS credential dumping, brute force attacks, cloud credential harvesting
- **Discovery**: System information discovery, network scanning, advanced reconnaissance
- **Lateral Movement**: Remote services, valid accounts, stealth techniques
- **Collection**: Data from local systems, screen capture, advanced collection methods
- **Command and Control**: Standard protocols, custom protocols, encrypted communication
- **Exfiltration**: C2 channels, scheduled transfers, encrypted exfiltration

### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
The application includes 50+ mapped techniques across all 11 MITRE ATT&CK tactics, providing comprehensive coverage of MarbleCone's known capabilities.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a simulation environment designed for educational and testing purposes only.

- **No Real Malware**: All activities are simulated and do not execute actual malicious code
- **Controlled Environment**: Designed for isolated testing and training
- **Educational Purpose**: Intended for cybersecurity training and threat research
- **No External Communication**: All activities are contained within the local environment

## Customization

### Adding New Adversaries
To add new threat actors, modify the adversary profile in `app.py`:

```python
NEW_ADVERSARY_PROFILE = {
    'id': 'new-adversary',
    'name': 'New Threat Actor',
    'description': 'Description of the threat actor',
    'tactics': [...],
    'techniques': [...],
    'abilities': [...]
}
```

### Modifying MarbleCone Profile
Edit the `MARBLECONE_PROFILE` dictionary in `app.py` to customize:
- Threat actor information
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings
- Execution abilities
- Target sectors

### Styling
Customize the appearance by modifying the CSS in `templates/base.html`:
- Color scheme
- Layout
- Typography
- Interactive elements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**:
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)`

2. **Database errors**:
   - Delete `marblecone.db` and restart the application

3. **Template errors**:
   - Ensure all template files are in the `templates/` directory

4. **Dependency issues**:
   - Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`

5. **Missing MarbleCone image**:
   - Add `marblecone.jpg` to the `static/` directory

### Logs
Check the console output for error messages and debugging information.
